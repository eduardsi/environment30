Gizma is innovative FinTech company operating in Europe and Middle East. Our mission is to provide clients with easily accessible financial tools to take advantage of the latest technology, applied in everyday life. Ambitious missions require out-of-the-box thinking, therefore we’re looking for talented individuals interested in building products that rock.

**What does it mean to be a developer at Gizma?**<br>
Since software is core part of our business, there is no gap between IT and business - we work as a single cross-functional team where all opinions and ideas matter. Because continuous innovation and continuous delivery are part of our daily life, we don’t have formal processes that our competitors tend to apply - we focus on collaboration instead.

**We care about our products** <br>
Product development goes far beyond coding. We strive to understand problem domain, work closely with customers, inject new ideas and experiment a lot. Regular R&D days are just small part of it.

**We care about software quality**<br>
Everyone in the team thinks long-term and aspires to write clean and maintainable code. We take ownership over architecture and automated testing. Refactoring, TDD and occasional pair programming are part of our daily life.

**We are extremely pragmatic**<br>
We always stick to “best tool for the problem” approach - we listen to industry trends with big interest, but evaluate everything in our context. We do things that matter to our customers now, but maintain vision to stay on the right path. We try to achieve more by working smart, not hard.

**We stay modern**
- Our backend runs on Java 8, Groovy, Spring, Hibernate, Camel, Hazelcast, Guava and other spices
- Our services speak REST
- Our web runs on HTML5 with Angular
- Our infrastructure is backed by Rackspace, Ansible, Jenkins and Gradle
- Our lightweight process is based on Kanban and Scrum or a mix of both
